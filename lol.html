        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            Love of Language is a student enhancement program located in Mississauga, Ontario. 
            It was designed to promote language skills that exceed the standard school curriculum. 
            The company is owned and operated by Dr. Noorin Manji, who is currently a Professor at The University of Waterloo (UW). 
            We were tasked with redesigning the LOL website to analyze the existing content and redesign it to improve the overall branding of the business as well as ensuring it is accessible to children with learning challenges.
            I also led the design for Love of Language's first mobile responsive site which created an easy navigation experience on their customersâ€™ mobile devices.
