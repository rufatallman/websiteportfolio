        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            Love of Language is a student enhancement program located in Mississauga, Ontario. It 
            was designed to promote language skills that exceed the standard school curriculum. The 
            company is owned and operated by Dr. Noorin Manji, who is currently a Professor at The 
            University of Waterloo (UW). We were tasked with redesigning the LOL website to analyze 
            the existing content and redesign it to improve the overall branding of the business as 
            well as ensuring it is accessible to children with learning challenges. I also led the design 
            for Love of Language's first mobile responsive site which created an easy navigation 
            experience on their customersâ€™ mobile devices..
        </p>
        <h3>Project Details</h3>
        <h4>Design Goal</h4>
        <p>
            Improve the user experience of the website (home page, our program, contact us), 
            modernize the online identity, revamp the SEO, and create a mobile friendly navigation.
        </p>
        <h4>Target Users</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><p>10 to 18 years old</p></li>
            <li><p>Parents seeking educational enrichment</p></li>
            <li><p>High-achieving students</p></li>
            <li><p>Students seeking acedamic support</p></li>
            <li><p>Students preparing for standardized tests</p></li>
          </ul>
        <h4>Design Criteria</h4>
        <p>
            Clean and modern - Keeping the same colours, but focusing on them more effectively. 
            When considering the use of colours, we need to decrease the visual friction present.
        </p>
        <p class="design">Ease of use - Redesign needs to create a clean aesthetic across each page, 
            incorperating a joyful minimal aesthetic.
        </p>
        <h4>Sitemap</h4>
        <p>
            In this project, content pages such as the home page, our program page, and contact us 
            page, need to be redesigned and implemented. Each page was redesigned to help the business
            create a friendly, welcoming website that will open the user base to more opportunities. 
            The sitemap below organizes the order of these pages and the relations between them.

        <h3>UX Redesign</h3>
        <p class="ux">
            The original Love of Language site had a poor user experience. This was mostly due
            to the content organization:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Elements were cluttered, making readability an issue</p></li>
            <li><p>Little-to-no spacing between content blocks</p></li>
            <li><p>Lack of visual hierarchy</p></li>
            <li><p>Unable to differentiate each program from one another</p></li>
            <li><p>Important information is lost in large bodies of text</p></li>
            <li><p>No visual balance present, most of the information was conveyed through text</p></li>
            <li><p>Poor accessiblity due to poor readability set by the colour contrast</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="after">
            After going over all the issues with my team, I started mocking up design solutions for 
            each page. Below is a comparison between the original product detailed page and the 
            redesigned one.

        <h3>Visual Design</h3>
        <p>
            Besides redesigning the user experience of Our Program page, we also needed to
            redesign the other sections of the site: Home and Contact Us.
        </p>
        <p>
            The visual design for the other pages follows the characteristics of the brand. It aims to 
            give visitors a sense of friendly, and welcoming vibe that will open the userbase to more
            opportunities. All pages are using a consistent design system, maintaining a minimum aesthetic,
            while also incorperating rounded corners and circles to create a soft, visual appeal for the 
            users.  
        </p>

    <div class="page">
        <h3>Mobile Design</h3>
        <p>
            In this project, each page is designed for the mobile screen size to ensure a great 
            registration and browsing experience.
        </p>
    </div>
    <img class="mobile" src="Images/mobile.png">
    <div class="page">
        <h3>Design Systems</h3>
        <p>
            To ensure the components are implemented consistently across the site, I created a UI 
            guide with details on color palettes, typography, and reusable UI elements.
